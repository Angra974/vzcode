# vzcode
Multiplayer code editor system

 * Open source code editor for JavaScript
 * Support for real-time collaboration
 * Focus on instant feedback during development
 * Built on open source: CodeMirror, NodeJS, ShareDB 
 * Core component of [VizHub](https://vizhub.com/) next generation editor

Just getting started here! Nothing in this repo yet... but there is a working demo at https://vizhub.community/ci/viz1, whose source code lives at https://github.com/vizhub-core/vizhub/tree/main/vizhub-v3 . Also we'll draw from this standalone CodeMirror6 collaboration demo: https://github.com/vizhub-core/vizhub/tree/main/vizhub-v3/vizhub-codemirror. For this project we'll port components out of that demo so that the code editor is totally independent and isolated from anything specific to VizHub.

It will look something like this ☝️ once it's working. This VZCode project will draw inspiration (and possibly implementation) from the existing open source editor component of VizHub, and various prototypes that have been done with CodeMirror6.

Collaborators welcome! I'm holding a meeting on Monday January 23 at 2pm Eastern (Video call link: https://meet.google.com/ajx-nmpx-ygt), feel free to drop in if you have any interest in collaborating on this project or providing input!
