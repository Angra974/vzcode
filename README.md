# vzcode
Multiplayer code editor system

 * Open source code editor for JavaScript
 * Support for real-time collaboration
 * Focus on instant feedback during development
 * Built on open source: CodeMirror, NodeJS, ShareDB 
 * Core component of [VizHub](https://vizhub.com/) next generation editor

Just getting started here! Nothing in this repo yet... but there is a working demo at https://vizhub.community/ci/viz1, whose source code lives at https://github.com/vizhub-core/vizhub/tree/main/vizhub-v3 . Also we'll draw from this standalone CodeMirror6 collaboration demo: https://github.com/vizhub-core/vizhub/tree/main/vizhub-v3/vizhub-codemirror. For this project we'll port components out of that demo so that the code editor is totally independent and isolated from anything specific to VizHub.
